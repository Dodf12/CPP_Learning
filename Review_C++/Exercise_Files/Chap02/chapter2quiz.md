I got 10/14 in the quiz

First wrong answer:

The main function is called by the operating system

True of False

I put false.

The correct answer is true


Second wrong answer:
I messed up the pointers and references problem because I dont know what they area.

I will write this when I learned properly what they are

References are aliases, which is another name for an
existing variable

Pointer is like a variable that "points" to another variable. Rather than storing the data of a pointer
in the memory, th epointer simply points to an existing variable that is already stored? Something like that
You need to attach the *(asteriks) to it in order for it to dereferenced

The main difference between them is that a reference
variable provides a new name to an already existing 
variable, while a pointer variable stores an address


 

Third wrong answer:
Which characters are restricted when defining identifiers in C++?

I put Numbers are allowd, but not as the first character.

This is wrong. This option is right,
but there is a better option.

C++ Reserces 73 keywords and 11 tokens. This works



Fourth Wrong Answer:
Question
Once defined, a reference can never be re-assigned

The answer is true.
